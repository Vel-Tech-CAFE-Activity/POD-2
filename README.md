<h2><strong>FRONTEND:</strong></h2>

<p id="description">With the modern digitization of the technology a lot of upload systems have come to light. Even with such introduction of systems there exist an acute need of analytical upload systems with user-specific control conditions. Recently the concept of file uploading has become very common in our environment but it does not have further functions apart from accepting file and storing it in the local drive or the database.

<h2><strong>BACKEND:</strong></h2>

<p id="description">This project implements a file upload and validation system for achieving this target. This file upload component is a library that makes file uploading much more flexible to all applications with slight code shifts. This component is built for re-usability and generic functionality. It gathers the module name from the user where it needs to be stored in a database. The file will be transferred to the back-end spring boot service through the HTTP module using the secure POST method. Spring boot is a Standalone application with an embedded server. It read those file and check for constraints acceptance. After satisfying those constraints then the constraints acknowledgement is sent to the user. Then it processes the file for compatibility and stores the file on a local and MongoDB database as a record within the module.</p>
